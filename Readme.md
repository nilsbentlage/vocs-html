# HTML Vokabeltrainer

This project is a vocabulary trainer created as an educational tool to teach children about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a fun and interactive way to learn both programming and new vocabulary!

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main files:

1. `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that contains the structure of the web page.
2. `style.css`: This file contains all the styles used in the project. It makes our vocabulary trainer look nice and attractive.
3. `index.js`: This is where all the magic happens. It contains the JavaScript code that powers the functionality of our vocabulary trainer.

## How to Run

To run this project, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Code Overview

The JavaScript code defines a class `VokabelTest` that represents the vocabulary trainer. It has methods for displaying a new word, checking the user's answer, keeping track of the score, and more.

The HTML code defines the structure of the vocabulary trainer, including areas to display the word, accept the user's answer, and show the current score.

The CSS code defines the visual style of the vocabulary trainer, including colors, layouts, and animations.

## Project Levels

This project is structured into different levels, from `level_09` to `level_01`. Each level represents a stage in the development of the vocabulary trainer, with `level_09` being the simplest and `level_01` being the most complex.

Here's a brief overview of what each level contains:

- `level_09`: This is the starting point of the project. At this level, we introduce the basic structure of the HTML page.

- `level_08`: In this level we add some JavaScript to make the HTML do it's magic

- `level_07`: Here, we start adding some basic styles to our page using CSS.

- `level_06`: At this level, we add a display for the result of the current answer

- `level_05`: Here, we enhance the display of the result by adding some animations

- `level_04`: At this level, we add some more logic and an end to the game, when all entrys in our list were filled in correctly

- `level_03`: Here, we add a score-counter to vizualize the progress

- `level_02`: At this level, we enhance our vocabulary trainer with a mode switch to alter the asked language

- `level_01`: This is the final level of the project. Here, we have a fully functional vocabulary trainer with a complete set of features. We will now learn about JavaScript classes and restructure our code

As we progress from `level_09` to `level_01`, the complexity and functionality of the vocabulary trainer increase. This structure allows us to gradually introduce new concepts and complexity, making it easier to learn and understand.
